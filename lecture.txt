In order to use routing in react we have to install a package called as react-router-dom
After installing package three important things to be imported from that package
BrowserRouter : that can be only one in one react-app no nested routers are allowed
Routes : this is the replacement for nested routing using switch 
Route : this is the component accept props include path and element that is component

--For doing nested routing ,the sample is below
What if we have to do nested routing from about page,then

//in main app
<Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<Home/>}
    <Route path='/about*' element={<Home/>}
</Routes>

//in about component
<Routes>
    <Route path='team' element={<Team/>}
    <Route path='developers' element={<Developers/>}
</Routes>
